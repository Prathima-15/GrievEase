## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### Check Backend Logs
```
📊 Found 12 petitions matching filters
✅ Returning 6 petitions (page 1)
```

### Check Network Tab
- Request URL: `http://localhost:8000/petitions/browse?search=...`
- Status: 200 OK
- Response: JSON with petitions array

### Check Console
```javascript
console.log('Petitions:', petitions);
console.log('Total count:', totalCount);
console.log('Selected filters:', selectedStatuses, selectedCategories);
```

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No petitions showing | Check `is_public = true` in database |
| Filters empty | Run `setup_basic_data.py` for categories/departments |
| 404 error | Ensure running `enhanced_main.py` not `main.py` |
| CORS error | Check CORS settings include frontend URL |
| Loading forever | Check backend is running and accessible |
