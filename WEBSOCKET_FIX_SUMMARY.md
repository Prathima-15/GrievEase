# WebSocket Implementation Fix Summary

## Problem
The backend had WebSocket imports and connection management, but the actual WebSocket endpoints were missing from `enhanced_main.py`. This caused a **403 Forbidden** error when the frontend tried to connect.

Error observed:
```
INFO:     127.0.0.1:51305 - "WebSocket /ws/petitions/my/3" 403
INFO:     connection rejected (403 Forbidden)
INFO:     connection closed
```

## Root Cause
- WebSocket endpoints (`@app.websocket`) were present in `main.py` and `main_backup.py`
- But they were **missing** from `enhanced_main.py` which is the active backend file
- Frontend was correctly trying to connect, but the backend had no endpoint to accept the connection

## Changes Made

### Backend (`enhanced_main.py`)

#### 1. Added WebSocket Endpoints
```python
@app.websocket("/ws/petitions/my/{user_id}")
async def petitions_ws(websocket: WebSocket, user_id: int):
    """User-specific WebSocket for real-time petition updates"""
    
@app.websocket("/ws/petitions")
async def global_petitions_ws(websocket: WebSocket):
    """Global WebSocket fallback for all clients"""
```

#### 2. Added Notification Helper Function
```python
async def notify_user_petitions(user_id: int, petitions: List[Petition]):
    """Send petition updates to connected WebSocket clients"""
```

This function:
- Serializes petition data
- Sends updates to user-specific WebSocket connections
- Falls back to global connections
- Handles connection cleanup on errors

#### 3. Integrated WebSocket Notifications

**In `create_petition` endpoint:**
- Made the function `async`
- Added WebSocket notification after petition creation
- Sends updated petition list to connected clients

**In `update_petition_status` endpoint:**
- Made the function `async`
- Added WebSocket notification after status update
- Notifies user in real-time when admin updates petition status

### Frontend (`MyPetitionsPage.tsx`)

#### Fixed User ID Access
**Before:**
```typescript
const uid = (user as any)?.userId ?? (user as any)?.userId ?? (user as any)?.userId;
```

**After:**
```typescript
const uid = user?.userId;
console.log("User ID for WebSocket:", uid);
```

#### Updated Dependencies
Changed from `user?.userId` to `user` in the useEffect dependency array for better reactivity.

## How It Works Now

### Connection Flow
1. **User logs in** → Frontend receives user object with `userId`
2. **MyPetitionsPage loads** → Establishes two WebSocket connections:
   - User-specific: `ws://localhost:8000/ws/petitions/my/{userId}`
   - Global fallback: `ws://localhost:8000/ws/petitions`
3. **Backend accepts connections** → Stores WebSocket in `user_connections` dict

### Real-Time Updates
1. **User creates petition** → Backend saves and calls `notify_user_petitions()`
2. **Admin updates status** → Backend saves and calls `notify_user_petitions()`
3. **WebSocket sends message** → Frontend receives update
4. **Frontend updates UI** → Petition list refreshes automatically

### Message Format
```json
{
  "type": "update",
  "petitions": [
    {
      "petition_id": 1,
      "title": "Fix Road",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "submitted_at": "2025-10-31T12:00:00",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

## Testing

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd backend/DataBase
python enhanced_main.py
```

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Verify WebSocket Connection
1. Open browser console
2. Log in as a user
3. Navigate to "My Petitions"
4. Look for console logs:
   - `User ID for WebSocket: 3`
   - `User WS open 3`
   - `Global WS open`

### 4. Test Real-Time Updates
1. Keep "My Petitions" page open
2. Have admin update petition status in another tab/window
3. Petition list should update automatically without page refresh

## Error Handling

### Backend
- WebSocket errors don't fail HTTP requests
- Disconnected clients are automatically removed from connection lists
- Errors are logged but don't affect petition operations

### Frontend
- Connection failures are logged as warnings (not errors)
- Falls back to global WebSocket if user-specific fails
- Periodic refetch ensures data consistency even without WebSocket

## Benefits

✅ **Real-time updates** - Users see status changes immediately  
✅ **No polling needed** - Reduces server load  
✅ **Better UX** - Instant feedback when petitions are created/updated  
✅ **Scalable** - Separate connections per user  
✅ **Resilient** - Multiple fallback mechanisms  

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Authentication** - Add token validation for WebSocket connections
2. **Heartbeat** - Implement ping/pong for connection health
3. **Reconnection** - Auto-reconnect on connection loss
4. **Message Queue** - Buffer messages if client temporarily disconnects
5. **Admin Dashboard** - Add WebSocket for admin petition list updates
